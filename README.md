## 🤖 ML Risk Analysis

The Python microservice analyzes student performance and returns a risk level:

| Risk Level | Score | Description |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 🟢 Green | 0 - 30 | Student is performing well |
| 🟡 Yellow | 31 - 60 | Student needs attention |
| 🔴 Red | 61 - 100 | Student is at serious risk |

**Factors analyzed:**
- Overall average score
- Grade trend (improving or declining)
- Number of failing subjects (below 60%)
- Subject-wise performance breakdown
